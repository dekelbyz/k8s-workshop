# K8s workshop

Welcome to the k8s workshop
in this workshop we will demonstrate a k8s cluster using minikube
we will create a live cluster with deployments, services, namespaces and much more fun stuff.
We will split the work by using branches. Every branch will represent the current
state of knowledge / progress we're at at the moment.

## Installation

we want to make sure we have minikube installed on our computer 
in order to run a 1-machine kubernetes cluster.
minikube has `kubectl` installed as a dependency so we won't have to install it seperatly.

```brew install minikube```
```minikube start```
```brew install kubectx```
---
## Let's start
```git checkout lesson-1```
